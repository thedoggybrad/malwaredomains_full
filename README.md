EasyList (AdBlock Plus), decided to shut this filter down. But this repository is one of the archive of this filter.
<br>
This repository aims to preserve the original file, so this repository will be edited to present information, but the original filterlist file will never be changed/modified in any way.

Special Note: As this filter is just an archive of the original one. New adwares or false positive fixes will not be applied. This is just for the sake of preservation.
<br>
<br>
Note: This filter could not be the final/latest release, as this one is just from WayBackMachine. The copy we have here is from 16 Sep 2020 02:00 UTC.

<br>
<br>
Final Note: To observe, preservation of the original file (Published by AdBlock Plus/EasyList) this repository turned into an archive on December 5, 2022. The links will still work.
